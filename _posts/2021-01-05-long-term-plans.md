Since it's the New Year and all that, I thought it'd be a good chance to leave myself a memo as to the long-term plans I have regarding web-presence and this site.

- First, I'll do something proper and not simply rely on github pages
  - Self-hosting is ideal, though it's going to take some time to learn how to do it properly
  - Domains are a pain but oh-well
  - Already not a fan of Jekyll, I'll probably roll my own because then I can work how I want
- Blog posts on various topics
  - Primarily there as notes to my future self
  - Evolving notes in several cases, need to decide how to link
  - Also so I can point others to and not have to reiterate myself
- Sidenotes and styling
  - Basic styling, try and promote readability
  - Sidenotes, because footnotes suck
  - Lightweight & accessible is the goal
- Web-presence things like
  - Fediverse & Mastodon
  - Reading list etc. with thoughts (for my own use / future reference, honestly)
  - Links to interesting stuff
- Projects
  - Hopefully I can restart some projects
  - Live stuff on this site would be nice, likely toy projects, interactive experiments, and demos
  - Long term transition of my personal toolkit, including this site

As things progress, my ideal is to start to operate more in the open, particularly once projects reach a point of maturity wherein they'd likely benefit more from being worked on in public.

There's plenty to be done, and there's some experiments that I'd like to do. It's going to be a busy year, but hopefully it'll end up an important and foundational one going forward on several fronts, myself included.
