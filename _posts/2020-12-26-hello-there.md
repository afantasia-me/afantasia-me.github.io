I've kept thinking about making a blog, and have been asked about it before. Considering that I finally started catching a break this year as of Christmas Eve, I decided to throw together something extremely basic.

This will not be a regular spot, but hopefully my workload from this point will be less hectic, and so I will actually be able to get back into the swing of things and potentially be at least semi-regular. Some things have been ported from Notion and GDocs, it's now all local-first markdown with text editors and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I'll probably do a write-up about _that_ experience eventually.
