I've kept thinking about making a blog, and have been asked about it before. Considering that I finally started catching a break this year as of Christmas Eve, I decided to throw together something extremely basic.

This will not be a regular spot, but hopefully my workload from this point will be less hectic, and so I will actually be able to get back into the swing of things and potentially be at least semi-regular. Some things might just be ported from [Notion](https://notion.so) which I've been using over [GDocs](https://docs.google.com). I'll probably do a write-up about _that_ experience in particular, since there's a lot to consider now, and at some point I'll migrate away from Notion, but for now I'm enjoying it and the only major gripe I have is performance (there's some Android-specific issues, but they're minor).
