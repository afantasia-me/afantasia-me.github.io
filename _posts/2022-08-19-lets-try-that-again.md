I'm not particularly interested in being a regular blogger or such. Frankly, that sounds far too tiring, given my interests lie elsewhere. But, I see more the benefit than ever in producing long-form pieces that I can have as living artifacts of my thinking. Especially artifacts I can show and share, when the need arises. However, my work over the last two years turned out more hectic than anticipated, so I've had little incentive to put the effort into this experiment.

So, a compromise of sorts. I've a few things I'd like to put into words, and rather than my typical notes, I'm going to try and place them here.
