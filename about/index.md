I read books 📚 and drink tea 🍵.

My usual pseudonym is A. Fantasia (stylised: aFantasia), while my online handle is babel.
- A. Fantasia is a self-reference (note the stylisation). Not too hard to figure out.
- babel is after Jorge Luis Borges, sadly not Douglas Adams.
  + I'm not cut out to be a translator, sorry!

You can sometimes find me:

  + Bird app: [@aFantasia__](https://twitter.com/aFantasia__)
- Talking nonsense (and sometimes working on games)

I thank [Sangled](https://twitter.com/sangled) for their wonderful picrew (now sadly 404'd), used for pfp.
