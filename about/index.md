I read books 📚, drink tea 🍵, and sometimes even upload what I write 🖊️.

My usual pseudonym is A. Fantasia (stylised: aFantasia), while my online handle is @babel.
- A. Fantasia is a self-reference (note the stylisation). Not too hard to figure out.
- Atelier Fantasia is a one-person "circle", basically my self-publishing label.
- @babel is after Jorge Luis Borges, sadly not Douglas Adams.
  + I'm not cut out to be a translator, sorry!
  + StoryStratos is attached to some old accounts, but usually with this as a display name.

You can sometimes find me:

- Writing: [aFantasia](https://archiveofourown.org/users/aFantasia)
  + Toot app: <a rel="me" href="https://masto.ai/@afantasia">@afantasia</a>
  + Bird app: [@aFantasia__](https://twitter.com/aFantasia__)
- Talking nonsense (and sometimes working on games)
  + Toot app: <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@babel">@babel</a>
  + Bird app: babel [@StoryStratos](https://twitter.com/StoryStratos)
- On discord: @babel (babel#0001)
